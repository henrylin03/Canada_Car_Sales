# Canada Car Sales

Mini-project to analyse [Canada Cars Sales Figures (2019-2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/mohamedhanyyy/canada-cars-sales-figures-20192021); a Kaggle dataset as 2 Sep 2021 (Version 6).

The purpose is to practice and apply Python (Pandas) & SQL (SQLite) knowledge.

This is actually my first Pandas/SQL project, so would love to know what you guys think! If you have any feedback, please feel free to add it in the "Issues" section above!
